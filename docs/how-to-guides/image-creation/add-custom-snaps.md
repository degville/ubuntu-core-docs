# Add custom snaps

An Ubuntu Core image is built using the {ref}`ubuntu-image <how-to-guides-image-creation-use-ubuntu-image>` command with a signed model assertion:

```bash
ubuntu-image snap ubuntu-core-20-amd64.model
```

> See {ref}`Build your own Ubuntu Core image <ref-index-build-your-first-image>` for more details on the entire process.

_ubuntu-image_ tool retrieves signed snaps with the given _snap-id_ in the model assertion from the store. To override these default snaps, first make sure the [model assertion](/reference/assertions/model.md#model-assertion-fields) has a grade of dangerous to allow non-store snaps to be included:

```
grade: dangerous
```

The `ubuntu-image` command can now build an image using locally sourced and built snaps, such as a custom gadget snap:

```bash
ubuntu-image snap my-model.model --snap ./pc_20-0.4_amd64.snap
```

It is also possible to pre-download the snaps included in a model assertion, and include them manually with the `--snap` flag. This uses the locally cached copies and can save download and build time, which is useful for testing.

You can now use the image to boot either real or virtual hardware. From within a running session on a custom image, you can run the pre-installed snap. Use `snap list` to see which snaps are installed:

```bash
$ snap list
Name       Version            Rev    Tracking       Publisher      Notes
core20     20250429           2582   latest/stable  canonical✓     base

```

The `snap model --assertion` command will show the read-only custom model assertion used to build the image:

```
