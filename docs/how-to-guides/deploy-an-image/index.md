# Deploy an image

We create pre-built Ubuntu Core images for several testing platforms. These images are a way to explore Ubuntu Core. Canonical produces official images for the [following platforms](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/supported-platforms).

## Install on a specific device

We also provide instructions for building and installing an Ubuntu Core image on a specific device.

## Image writing

For generic devices, we recommend users try pre-built Ubuntu Core images on a Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC, as these range of devices are easy to use and widely accessible.

- {ref}`Use Raspberry Pi imager <ref-use-raspberry-pi-imager-use-raspberry-pi-imager>`: install a pre-built Ubuntu Core image on a Raspberry Pi
- {ref}`Use the dd command <tutorials-get-started-try-pre-built-images-install-on-a-device-use-the-dd-command>`: write an Ubuntu Core reference image to internal storage
