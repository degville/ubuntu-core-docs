# Stores

A store hosts and provides both the snap packages themselves and signed assertions required to securely maintain and update an Ubuntu Core device.

## Running a store

Applications and updates are delivered from a _store_. By default, this is Canonicalâ€™s Snap Store, but it can also be a dedicated snap store of your own, controlled through a _brand account_.
